        "description": "A fishing rod is a long, flexible rod used to catch fish. At its simplest, a fishing rod is a simple stick or pole attached to a line ending in a hook (formerly known as an angle, hence the term angling). The length of the rod can vary between 2 and 20 feet (0.61 and 6.10 m). To entice fish, bait or lures are impaled on one or more hooks attached to the line. The line is generally stored on a reel which reduces tangles and assists in landing a fish."

        "description": "The octopus is a soft-bodied, eight-limbed mollusc of the order Octopoda. Around 300 species are recognised, and the order is grouped within the class Cephalopoda with squids, cuttlefish, and nautiloids. Like other cephalopods, the octopus is bilaterally symmetric with two eyes and a beak, with its mouth at the center point of the eight limbs (traditionally called arms, also mistakenly called tentacles). The soft body can rapidly alter its shape."

There are countless ways to get injured — a flailing fish sends a treble hook deep into your palm; careless handling of a catfish results in being stabbed by a venomous spine; or a filleting knife slips and cuts your finger to the bone. Fishing gloves safeguard you against such mishaps. Some are also meant for weather protection."
